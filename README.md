# PL Compiler Lexical Analyzer

## Description

This project was developed as part of a University Academic Project. It implements a lexical analyzer for the PL programming language, a C-like imperative language. The analyzer reads source code, identifies and classifies tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, comments, and symbols), and outputs the token stream for further syntactic analysis.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Design and implementation of a lexical analyzer for a custom programming language.
- Tokenization of source code, including handling of keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, comments, and whitespace.
- Application of string processing and pattern matching algorithms.
- Practice with Python programming for compiler construction tasks.
- Understanding of language grammar and lexical rules.
- Error detection and reporting in lexical analysis.

**Summary:** This project allowed us to practice compiler front-end design, lexical analysis algorithms, and robust tokenization for programming languages.
